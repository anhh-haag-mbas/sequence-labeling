Current status
    Dynet implementation of network with polyglot embedding and CRF ~94 accuracy??? 
        Based on paper mentioned by Zeljko
        Using universal dependencies data
    Similar but worse performing(???) Model in pytorch
    Unsure how much theory we need to understand, in particular CRF
    Working on NER, unsure of what data to use
    How much and what to read
        Primary sources Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing (Yoav Goldberg)
        Second (difficult) source Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)
        Some ACL Papers
    Unsure of how much to do with model implementations, batching, auto-batching, etc. 
        How to make meaningful comparison if we don't make equivalent models
    Decided on some parameters to work on, need input on these
        Zeljko mentioned to limit the parameters as much as possible
        Still looking for argument for which languages to choose
            Some representative which we have data for in each task, embeddings, etc.


Papers on typologi

Pytorch comparisons

12 languages 2 from each family

Might want to sketch out tables to see what we expect
    To see progerss

End of week 16 stop doing experiments
