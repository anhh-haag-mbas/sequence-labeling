# CRF

1. A statistical modeling method for structured prediction.
2. Part of the sequence modeling family.
3. Can take context into account, e.g. the linear chain CRF.

4. A discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model.
5. Used to encode known relationships between observations and construct consistent interpretations.

## Statistical model

1. A mathematical model that embodies some statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data
2. Represents (in an idealized form) the data-generating process
3. Usually specified as a mathematical relationship between one or more random variables 
4. Hypothesis tests and estimators are derived via statistical models
5. Part of the foundation of statistical inference

### Mathematical models

1. A description of a system using mathematical concepts and language

Examples 
* The deterministic finite automaton
* Map projection
* Population growth

### Statistical assumptions

Examples
* Independence of observations from each other
* Independence of observational error from confounding effects
...

### Statistical inference

1. The process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution
2. Can be contrasted with descriptive statistics which only cares about the observed data and not the population from where the data is sampled from

#### Data analysis

1. Inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information 

Example
* Data mining

## Structured prediction

1. Umbrella term for supervised machine learning techniques that involves predicting structures objects rather than scalar discrete or real values

Example
* Sequence tagging
* Parse tree

## Discriminative vs generative

1. P(y|x) vs P(x, y)

## Probabilistic graphical model (PGM) 

1. A probabilistic(statistical) model where a graph represents the conditional dependence between random variables
