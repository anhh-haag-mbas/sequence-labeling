## Problem definition

Test bidirectional LSTM with a CRF layer in three different ML-frameworks
(PyTorch, TensorFlow, DyNet) to compare effeciency and correctness when using
different configurations. The tests will be conducted on a set of sequence
labelling tasks, such as POS tagging, named entity recognition, and maybe
others.

Especially, we want to compare how different configurations performs on
different tasks.


## Method

We will study relevant and modern theory on machine learning and natural
language processing, with a special emphasis on deep learning and neural
networks. This will include litterature, online material (text and video) and
occasional lectures.

We will collect data sets for testing and training a series of machine learning
models. We will compare the results of the tests by conducting systematic
analysis and documenting our steps along the way.

We will utilize three Python-based ML-frameworks - TensorFlow, PyTorch and DyNet -
with the aim of creating ML-models for efficient solving of sequence labelling
tasks.
