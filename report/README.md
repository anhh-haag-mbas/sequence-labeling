# Requirements
 - bash (the build scripts are written in bash)
 - texlive (includes the xelatex program)
 - latexmk (reruns xelatex as appropriate)
 - python (for syntax highlighting support)

# Building
While in the directory `report` run `bin/build`.

# Cleaning
While in the directory `report` run `bin/clean`, the next build will not use cached files.
