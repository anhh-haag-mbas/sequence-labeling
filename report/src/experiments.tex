\subsection{OOV results}

Comparing the two-layer \texttt{Bi-LSTM-CRF} of DyNet and the one-layer
\texttt{Bi-LSTM-CRF} of PyTorch on their ability to correctly classify
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, we see once again that the two-layer model of
DyNet performs slightly better. On average across languages, batch sizes, epochs
and seeds, the two-layer model has an OOV accuracy (ie.\ the percentage of
correctly classified OOV words) of 86.2\% for NER data, where as the one-layer
model only achieves an OOV accuracy 81.0\%. The results are shown in
Table~\ref{table:oov-accuracy-crf}.

    \caption{OOV accuracy for the \texttt{Bi-LSTM-CRF} models implemented in
        DyNet (two-layer model) and in PyTorch (one-layer model). The rows
        indicate the number of epochs run during training, where `patience'
        refers to a training session with early stopping after 3 consecutive
        epochs of declining accuracy in the validation set.
    }\label{table:oov-accuracy-crf}
\end{table}
 

For POS data, this is not the case, as the average accuracy actually tips in
favour of the one-layer model of PyTorch (88.4\% against 90.2\%). However, when
training using patience to determine when to stop, the upper hand is again with
the two-layer model, which achieves an OOV accuracy of 92.8\% against 91.8\%.
This is a small difference, and it could very well be the result of the PyTorch
implementation, in which it is not the optimal model, that is returned, but the
optimal model after three extra epochs of declining accuracy on the validation
set (see Section~\ref{} for more details).
