\subsubsection{Task definition}


\subsubsection{Data}

For the NER task we used auto-annotated wikipedia data
from~\ref{}{http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/wikiann/} created for the
paper~\ref{}{Cross-lingual Name Tagging and Linking for 282 Languages}. As the
title suggests, this dataset contains annotated data for 282 languages in
varying sizes. The datasets from~\ref{}{http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/wikiann/} are all
in BIO format, and since they were created based on wikipedia we didn't have to
take varying sources into considerations.

Since the data is auto-annotated it might not be of the same standard as the POS
data. Ideally this shouldn't affect the experiments since the word orderings are
still the same, and systematic errors in the data would happen for all languages
in the datasets.
