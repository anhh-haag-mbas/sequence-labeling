\subsection{Named Entity Recognition}

This section will go into the details of the Named Entity Recognition task, what
the specifics are, considerations in regards to the data used, any issues we
came across, and the results of our experiments.

\subsubsection{Task definition}

Named Entity Recognition is a classification task of different types of
entities, such as places, people, organisation, times, and more. Entities can
consist of one or more words (and/or numbers), eg.\ ``Eurovision Song Contest
2019'' is a single entity of 3 words and a number. The classifier should
correctly identify the whole entity and not just part of it. We didn't take this
into consideration before running the experiments so our results are on a word
by word basis and doesn't tell us if the whole entity was correctly classified
or not.

Usually the performance of a classifier for the NER task is measured by a $F_1$
Score, which considers the classifier's precision and recall. The precision is
the classifier's ability to correctly classify an entity given all attempts, and
recall is the ability to correctly classify an element given how many elements
exists. Say there are 100 entities in a document, the classifier finds 90
entities, 80 of them are correct, 10 of them are wrong, and 20 were not found.
From this we get the precision $P = {80 \over 80 + 10} = 0.88\ldots$, and recall $R
= {80 \over 80 + 20} = 0.8$. The $F_1$ score is simply the harmonic mean between
the precision and recall given by $F_1 = 2 \cdot {precision \cdot recall \over
precision + recall}$. Based on our example this would be $F_1 = 2 \cdot
{0.88 \ldots \cdot 0.8 \over 0.88\ldots + 0.8} = 0.8421$.~\ref{https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/yutaka.sasaki/F-measure-YS-26Oct07.pdf}.


\subsubsection{Data}

For the NER task we used auto-annotated wikipedia data from~\ref{}{Cross-lingual
Name Tagging and Linking for 282 Languages}. As the title suggests, this dataset
contains annotated data for 282 languages in varying sizes. 

The datasets are all in the BIO format, which has three different entities,
organisations, people, and locations. The entities BIO format uses the
convention that the beginning of an entity is prefixes with a B and the
continuation of an entity is prefixed with an I (for inside). Tokens which are
not part of an entity is labeled O (for other). This gives the 7 labels, B-ORG,
B-PER, B-LOC, I-ORG, I-PER, I-LOC, and O. 

Since all the datasets were created based on wikipedia data we didn't have to
take varying sources into considerations, as was necessary for the POS task.

Since the data is auto-annotated it might not be of the same standard as the POS
data. Ideally this shouldn't affect the experiments since the word orderings are
still the same, and systematic errors in the data would hopefully happen for all
languages in the datasets.

The way words have been split differs from the POS dataset, 

This turns out to be a positive since the polyglot embedding is similarly also
very character based.
