\subsubsection{Task definition}


\subsubsection{Data}

For this task we used datasets from~\ref{}{UniversalDependencies.org} which has
a broad selection of languages with multiple datasets (called treebanks) in
each. The datasets from~\ref{}{UniversalDependencies.org} are all in the CoNNL-U
format, but are created from different types of sources. The source types are
given as tags such as news, legal, blog, wiki, etc.

Since the datasets from~\ref{}{UniversalDependencies.org} comes pre-split, these
were concatenated before splitting into our own sizes. Concatenation happened
using the command ``cat *.conllu > combined.conllu'', since the convention for
the datasets is to name the files something with train, test, and dev, the
assumed order of the files is dev, test, and train. Meaning that if the dev set
(eg. the validation set) contains 5000 sentence, only these were used in our
datasets, and none of the sentences from the test or training-sets would be
used. No guarantees however were made to guarantee this ordering, so depending
on the naming conventions used in the specific treebanks this might differ.

Some datasets, such as the Norwegian dataset, contains contractions as well as
the individual words. Since the contration is usually unlabelled in the datasets
these were simply removed from the data for ease of parsing. This has the
obvious consequence that the models are not trained on the contractions of words
which are often more commonly used, this however shouldn't affect the
comparisons between word orderings since contractions shouldn't affect these.

The treebanks we selected from~\ref{}{UniversalDependencies.org} were all made
from news, where some used additional sources such as non-fiction and spoken. A
list of the languages, their respective treebank selected, and their tags is
given below.

* Arabic,   PADT, news

* Hindi,    HDTB, news

* Urdu,     UDTB, news

* Japanese, GSD, blog, news

* Danish,   DDT, fiction, news, non-fiction, spoken

* Norwegian,Bokmaal, blog, news, non-fiction

* Russian,  SynTagRus, fiction, news, non-fiction

The distribution of tokens, labels, etc.\ is given in appendix.
