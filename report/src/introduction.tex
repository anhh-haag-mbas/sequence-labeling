\subsection{Project background}

The project was conducted as a bachelor thesis as part of the Software
Development programme at the IT University of Copenhagen. 


\subsection{Problem description}

The project aim is to perform a large number of empirically based comparisons of
the performance of different machine learning models with well-defined
configurations and implemented in three different open source machine learning
frameworks on a set of languages grouped based on their respective word
ordering. A thorough comparative analysis of the results will be conducted to
possibly identify strengths and weaknesses of the individual frameworks as well
as of the models on different target languages.

A brief summary of the different configurations can be seen in figure (~\ref). A
more thorough and motivated description is provided in section (~\ref).

The hypothesis of the project is that\ldots


\subsection{Project plan}

The project began in february, and according to the plan, we should have built a
self-flying space rocket on the 21st of december. Also, it should be able to
perform part-of-speech tagging on hindu languages.
