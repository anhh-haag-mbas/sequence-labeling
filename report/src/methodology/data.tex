\subsection{Data}

This section will describe the process of finding and preparing the relevant
language data for the project. This includes considerations about which
languages to work with, what data sources was used, how the data was
preprocessed, etc.


\subsubsection{Choosing languages}

About choosing languages based on word ordering (and availability of good
datasets)


\subsubsection{Data gathering}

About our data sources (eg.\ Universal Dependencies), labelled datasets, size of
datasets and stuff like dat.


\subsubsection{Preprocessing}

Making all datasets the same size, and possibly something about how the data is
preprocessed in our programs (eg.\ adding padding)
