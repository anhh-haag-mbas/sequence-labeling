\subsection{Frameworks}

All experiments have been conducted across three popular and open source machine
learning frameworks, two dynamic and one static. Each member of the project
group have had responsibility for the implementation of the models in one of the
frameworks. This section will briefly describe the experience and caveates with
working with each of the frameworks.


\subsubsection{DyNet}

This the `magic' framework.


\subsubsection{PyTorch}

This was the dynamic framework that couldn't handle different sized batches.


\subsubsection{TensorFlow}

Haha, good luck
