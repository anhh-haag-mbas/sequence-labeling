\subsection{Models}

This section will cover the main theoretical aspects of the project and give a
general description of the mathematical principles behind the machine learning
models used in this project. It will also describe the different configurations
for our experiments and models, aswell as it will motivate the use of Polyglot
embeddings.


\subsubsection{Embeddings}

Polyglot embeddings are easier than FastText, but self-trained embeddings could
also have been fun!


\subsubsection{Bi-LSTM}

This is the easy one!

\begin{equation}
y = A * x + b
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{CRF}

This was not fun at all!


\subsubsection{Configurations}

Boy was there a lot!
